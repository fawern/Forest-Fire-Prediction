# Forest Fire Prediction Project

This project focuses on predicting the spread of forest fires using machine learning algorithms on the Forest Fire dataset. Originally, 
the aim was to estimate the fire area through regression, but the desired results were not achieved. 
As a result, the focus shifted to classifying whether the fire area would exceed 10 or not.

# Classification Task
The new objective is to classify instances into two categories: "danger" (fire area greater than 10) and "no-danger" (fire area less than or equal to 10). 
This approach aims to determine the extent of fire spread based on the dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Forest Fire dataset, containing various attributes such as temperature, humidity, wind, and rain, among others, 
to predict the burned area of forest fires.
